- with Xperia Tipo (low power phone) when the blob tab (camera image) is selected the app stops itself (no crash)...too much resources used?...heap memory
- add checkboxes in the UI for obstacle avoidance, cliff avoidance, speed control, soft acceleration (like in Wheelphone basic demo)
- add calibration button in the UI
